///
/// - **Paused**: Subscription is temporarily suspended, no charges are processed.

/// - **InsufficientBalance**: Subscription failed due to insufficient funds.
///   - This status is automatically set when a charge attempt fails due to insufficient
///     prepaid balance.
///   - Can transition to: `Active` (after deposit + resume), `Cancelled`
///   - The subscription cannot be charged while in this status.
///

///

/// 1. A [`crate::SubscriptionVault::charge_subscription`] call finds `prepaid_balance < amount`
/// 2. A [`crate::SubscriptionVault::charge_usage`] call drains the balance to zero

///

/// 1. Subscriber calls [`crate::SubscriptionVault::deposit_funds`] to add funds
/// 2. Subscriber calls [`crate::SubscriptionVault::resume_subscription`] to transition back to `Active`
/// 3. Subsequent charges will succeed if sufficient balance exists
///
/// - **GracePeriod**: Subscription is in grace period after a missed charge.
///   - Can transition to: `Active` (after deposit), `InsufficientBalance`, `Cancelled`

/// Invalid transitions (e.g., `Cancelled` -> `Active`) are rejected with
