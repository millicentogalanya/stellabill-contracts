//! Reentrancy protection for critical operations.
//!
//! This module provides a stateful guard mechanism to detect and prevent reentrancy
//! in functions that may be vulnerable to callbacks during external calls.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! **Locked State Pattern**: We use a per-function lock stored in contract storage to detect
//! if execution is already happening. This is effective for preventing callbacks from
//! reentering the same critical path.
//!
//! **Usage**:
//! ```ignore
//! let guard = ReentrancyGuard::lock(env, "function_name")?;
//! // Critical operations here
//! // Guard is automatically dropped when it goes out of scope
//! ```
//!
//! # Guarantees
//!
//! - **Atomic locking**: The lock is acquired and checked atomically within a single ledger state
//! - **Automatic cleanup**: Guards cleanup their own locks when dropped
//! - **Zero cost for non-reentrancy cases**: In normal (non-reentrancy) scenarios, guard creation
//!   and cleanup is negligible overhead
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! This guard **cannot prevent reentrancy across different functions** (e.g., `charge_subscription`
//! then `deposit_funds`). It only prevents the same function from being called recursively.
//! For full reentrancy safety, always follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern
//! where external calls happen after all internal state updates.
//!
//! # Best Practices
//!
//! 1. **Prefer CEI Pattern**: The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern is the primary defense.
//!    Use locks only for additional protection on critical paths.
//! 2. **Minimize Lock Scope**: Keep the critical section as small as possible.
//! 3. **Document Assumptions**: Always document why a lock is needed and what it protects.
