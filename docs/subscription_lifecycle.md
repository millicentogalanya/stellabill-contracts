# Subscription Lifecycle and State Machine

This document describes the subscription lifecycle in the SubscriptionVault contract: how subscriptions are created, charged, paused, resumed, and cancelled; how status is represented on-chain; and the state machine that governs valid transitions. It aligns with the implementation in `contracts/subscription_vault/src/`.

For a compact state-machine-only view see [subscription_state_machine.md](subscription_state_machine.md).

## Overview

A subscription moves through a lifecycle from creation (always starting **Active**) through optional deposits, charges, and user-driven actions (pause, resume, cancel). The **status** field of each subscription is constrained by a state machine: only certain transitions are allowed (e.g. Active → Paused, InsufficientBalance → Active). Charging is only performed when status is **Active**; insufficient balance during a charge automatically moves the subscription to **InsufficientBalance**. The **prepaid balance** is separate from status: deposits increase balance without changing status; the subscriber must explicitly **resume** after topping up to leave InsufficientBalance.

---

## On-Chain Representation

### Subscription struct

Defined in `contracts/subscription_vault/src/types.rs`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `subscriber` | `Address` | Owner of the subscription; must auth create, deposit. |
| `merchant` | `Address` | Recipient of charges. |
| `amount` | `i128` | Charge amount per interval (in token base units). |
| `interval_seconds` | `u64` | Minimum time between charges. |
| `last_payment_timestamp` | `u64` | Ledger timestamp of last successful charge. |
| **`status`** | **`SubscriptionStatus`** | Lifecycle state; only changed via state machine transitions. |
| `prepaid_balance` | `i128` | Current balance; increased by deposit, decreased by successful charge. |
| `usage_enabled` | `bool` | Usage flag (reserved for future use). |

The **status** field is the only one modified by the state machine. Other fields change only through specific operations: `prepaid_balance` and `last_payment_timestamp` change on deposit and charge; the rest are set at creation (or not changed).

### Storage

Subscriptions are stored in contract instance storage, keyed by subscription id (`u32`). Each key maps to a `Subscription` value. The contract also stores `next_id` for allocating new ids, plus admin/config (token, admin, min_topup).

---

## SubscriptionStatus Variants

The enum is defined in `contracts/subscription_vault/src/types.rs`. Transition rules are implemented in `contracts/subscription_vault/src/state_machine.rs`.

### Active

- **Meaning:** Subscription is active and eligible for charging. Charges succeed when interval has elapsed and balance is sufficient.
- **How entered:** Created by `create_subscription` (initial status); or by `resume_subscription` from Paused or InsufficientBalance.
- **How exited:** `pause_subscription` → Paused; `cancel_subscription` → Cancelled; or a failed charge (insufficient balance) → InsufficientBalance (automatic inside `charge_one`).
- **Charges:** Allowed. `charge_subscription` and `batch_charge` call `charge_one`, which runs only when status is Active.

### Paused

- **Meaning:** Temporarily suspended; no charges are processed.
- **How entered:** `pause_subscription` from Active (authorizer: subscriber or merchant).
- **How exited:** `resume_subscription` → Active; `cancel_subscription` → Cancelled.
- **Charges:** Not allowed. Charge returns `Error::NotActive` (1002) without changing state.

### Cancelled

- **Meaning:** Permanently terminated. No further state changes or charges.
- **How entered:** `cancel_subscription` from Active, Paused, or InsufficientBalance.
- **How exited:** None. Terminal state; no transitions out (any attempt returns `Error::InvalidStatusTransition`).
- **Charges:** Not allowed. Charge returns `Error::NotActive` (1002).

### InsufficientBalance

- **Meaning:** A stored non-active state representing a subscription that requires topping up and explicit resume before future charges can proceed.
- **How entered:** This state may exist in migrated or previously stored data, but current public charge entrypoints do not persist a transition into `InsufficientBalance` on failed charges.
- **How exited:** `resume_subscription` → Active (after the subscriber has deposited); `cancel_subscription` → Cancelled. The contract does **not** auto-transition to Active on deposit; the subscriber must call `resume_subscription` after topping up.
- **Charges:** Not allowed. Charge returns `Error::NotActive` (1002).

## State Machine and Transitions

### Allowed transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|--------|
| Active | Paused | `pause_subscription(subscription_id, authorizer)` |
| Active | Cancelled | `cancel_subscription(subscription_id, authorizer)` |
| Active | InsufficientBalance | Charge attempted and balance insufficient (inside `charge_one`) |
| Paused | Active | `resume_subscription(subscription_id, authorizer)` |
| Paused | Cancelled | `cancel_subscription(subscription_id, authorizer)` |
| InsufficientBalance | Active | `resume_subscription(subscription_id, authorizer)` |
| InsufficientBalance | Cancelled | `cancel_subscription(subscription_id, authorizer)` |
| *any* | Same | Idempotent: transition to same status is always allowed (e.g. cancel when already Cancelled) |

Implementation: `validate_status_transition` in `contracts/subscription_vault/src/state_machine.rs` is used before every status update; `get_allowed_transitions(status)` returns the list of valid target statuses for a given state.

### Invalid transitions (blocked)

| From | To | Result |
|------|-----|--------|
| Cancelled | Active | `Error::InvalidStatusTransition` (400) — terminal state |
| Cancelled | Paused | `Error::InvalidStatusTransition` (400) |
| Cancelled | InsufficientBalance | `Error::InvalidStatusTransition` (400) |
| Paused | InsufficientBalance | Not reachable (charges not run when Paused) |
| InsufficientBalance | Paused | `Error::InvalidStatusTransition` (400) — must resume or cancel |

## Lifecycle Flows

### Creation

- **Entrypoint:** `create_subscription(env, subscriber, merchant, amount, interval_seconds, usage_enabled)`  
  Auth: subscriber.  
  Implemented in `contracts/subscription_vault/src/subscription.rs`.
- **Effect:** A new subscription is stored with `status: Active`, `last_payment_timestamp: env.ledger().timestamp()`, `prepaid_balance: 0`. No charge runs at creation; the first charge requires a deposit and a later `charge_subscription` or `batch_charge` call.

### Deposit

- **Entrypoint:** `deposit_funds(env, subscription_id, subscriber, amount)`  
  Auth: subscriber.  
  Implemented in `subscription.rs`.
- **Effect:** Increases `prepaid_balance` by `amount` (subject to min_topup and non-negative checks). **Status is not changed.** To leave InsufficientBalance after a failed charge, the subscriber must deposit and then call `resume_subscription`.

### Charging

- **Entrypoints:** `charge_subscription(env, subscription_id)` and `batch_charge(env, subscription_ids)`.  
  Auth: admin.  
  Both delegate to `charge_one` in `contracts/subscription_vault/src/charge_core.rs`.
- **Behavior:** Only subscriptions with status **Active** are charged. If status is not Active, `charge_one` returns `Error::NotActive` (1002) without mutating storage. For Active subscriptions: if `now < last_payment_timestamp + interval_seconds`, returns `Error::IntervalNotElapsed` (1001). Otherwise attempts to deduct `amount` from `prepaid_balance`; on success updates balance and `last_payment_timestamp` and returns `Ok(())`; on insufficient balance it returns `Err(Error::InsufficientBalance)` (1003) without persisting failure-path ledger mutations.

### Pause / Resume / Cancel

- **Pause:** `pause_subscription(env, subscription_id, authorizer)` — validates transition to Paused, then sets `status = Paused`. Auth: subscriber or merchant. Implemented in `subscription.rs`.
- **Resume:** `resume_subscription(env, subscription_id, authorizer)` — validates transition to Active, then sets `status = Active`. Auth: subscriber or merchant. Implemented in `subscription.rs`.
- **Cancel:** `cancel_subscription(env, subscription_id, authorizer)` — validates transition to Cancelled, then sets `status = Cancelled`. Auth: subscriber or merchant. Implemented in `subscription.rs`.

All three use `validate_status_transition` before updating status.

---

## Invariants and Edge Cases

1. **Only Active subscriptions are charged.** Paused, Cancelled, and InsufficientBalance cause `charge_one` to return `Error::NotActive` (1002) immediately, with no state change.

2. **Failed interval charges do not persist hidden state transitions.** There is no public charge path that commits extra failure-path mutations that differ between single and batch charging. See `contracts/subscription_vault/src/charge_core.rs`.

3. **Cancelled is terminal.** No transitions out of Cancelled; resume and all other status changes from Cancelled return `Error::InvalidStatusTransition` (400).

4. **Idempotent same-status.** Transitioning to the same status (e.g. calling cancel when already Cancelled) is allowed by `validate_status_transition`, so callers can safely retry.

5. **Resume behavior remains explicit for stored non-active states.** Depositing does not change status. If a subscription is already in `InsufficientBalance`, the subscriber must call `resume_subscription` to move back to Active before the next charge can succeed.

6. **Interval check.** A charge is only attempted when `now >= last_payment_timestamp + interval_seconds`; otherwise `Error::IntervalNotElapsed` (1001) is returned.

7. **Batch charge.** `batch_charge` invokes `charge_one` per id and preserves the same ledger semantics as repeated single charges in input order. Successful items commit; failed items return their error code without extra side effects. Per-item errors are reported in `BatchChargeResult`; see `docs/batch_charge.md`.

## Error Codes (Lifecycle-Relevant)

From `contracts/subscription_vault/src/types.rs`:

| Code | Variant | When |
|------|---------|------|
| 400 | `InvalidStatusTransition` | Invalid status transition (e.g. Cancelled → Active). |
| 401 | `Unauthorized` | Caller not authorized (e.g. not admin for charge, not subscriber/merchant for cancel/pause/resume). |
| 402 | `BelowMinimumTopup` | Deposit below configured min_topup. |
| 404 | `NotFound` | Subscription id not found. |
| 1001 | `IntervalNotElapsed` | Charge attempted before interval elapsed. |
| 1002 | `NotActive` | Charge attempted on non-Active subscription. |
| 1003 | `InsufficientBalance` | Charge failed due to insufficient prepaid balance. |

---

## Example Timelines

### Happy path

1. Subscriber: `create_subscription` → subscription stored, status **Active**, balance 0.
2. Subscriber: `deposit_funds` → balance increased, status remains Active.
3. Admin: `charge_subscription` (after interval elapsed) → balance decreased, `last_payment_timestamp` updated, status Active.
4. Repeat 2–3 as needed; eventually subscriber or merchant: `cancel_subscription` → status **Cancelled** (terminal).

### Insufficient balance then recover

1. Create → Active; deposit some funds.
2. Admin: `charge_subscription` (or `batch_charge`) → balance too low → call returns `Error::InsufficientBalance` (1003) without committing extra failure-path state.
3. Subscriber: `deposit_funds` → balance increased.
4. Admin: a later charge with sufficient prepaid balance succeeds.

### Pause and resume

1. Subscription is Active. Subscriber or merchant: `pause_subscription` → **Paused**.
2. Later: same or other party: `resume_subscription` → **Active**. Alternatively: `cancel_subscription` from Paused → **Cancelled**.

## Golden Path Test Expectations

The end-to-end fixture coverage for maintainers lives in:

- `test_billing_lifecycle_golden_path_end_to_end`
- `test_billing_lifecycle_delayed_charge_and_min_topup_progression`

The native Soroban test harness assertions focus on balances, statuses, timestamps, withdrawals, and statement history. The vault event expectations below are documented for reviewer and indexer verification alongside those state assertions.

These tests use the shared fixture constants from `contracts/subscription_vault/src/test.rs`:

- `AMOUNT = 10_000_000` (10 USDC)
- `PREPAID = 50_000_000` (50 USDC)
- `INTERVAL = 30 days`
- `min_topup = 1_000_000` (1 USDC)

### Expected outputs: full golden path

1. After `create_subscription`: status is **Active**, `prepaid_balance = 0`, merchant balance is `0`, and the vault has emitted one `created` event.
2. After `deposit_funds(PREPAID)`: subscription balance is `50_000_000`, subscriber wallet is debited by the same amount, vault token balance becomes `50_000_000`, and one `deposited` event is visible from the vault contract.
3. After two successful interval charges: status remains **Active**, `prepaid_balance = 30_000_000`, `lifetime_charged = 20_000_000`, merchant balance becomes `20_000_000`, and the vault has emitted two `charged` events.
4. Statement reads must show two immutable rows with monotonic sequences `0` and `1`. Newest-first reads return sequence `1` first; cursor pagination returns `next_cursor = Some(0)` for the first page and `None` for the second.
5. After `withdraw_merchant_funds(20_000_000)`: merchant internal balance is `0`, merchant wallet receives `20_000_000`, vault token balance falls to `30_000_000`, and one `withdrawn` event is emitted by the vault.
6. After cancel plus subscriber refund: status is **Cancelled**, remaining prepaid balance is withdrawn back to the subscriber, and vault token balance returns to `0`.

### Expected outputs: delayed charge plus minimum top-up progression

1. Start with a `19_000_000` deposit. A delayed first charge at `T0 + 2 * INTERVAL + 77` still charges only one interval, leaving `prepaid_balance = 9_000_000`, `lifetime_charged = 10_000_000`, and merchant balance `10_000_000`.
2. A follow-up deposit of exactly `1_000_000` satisfies the configured minimum top-up and restores the prepaid balance to exactly one interval (`10_000_000`).
3. The next on-time charge reduces prepaid balance to `0`, raises merchant balance to `20_000_000`, and leaves two statement rows whose period boundaries reflect the actual delayed charge timestamp.

These expectations are intended to make reviews fast: if a future change alters one of the balances, statement sequences, cursor behavior, or vault-emitted event counts above, the golden-path tests should fail and prompt a lifecycle review.
